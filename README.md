# CatBot Guides
Guides for adding features to CatBot.

# Usage
CatBot uses multiple libraries, modules, and utilities, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
```bash
When making commands, make sure they are lowercase only.
using args[0] and anything higher is for each argument after the command.
Example: +command args[0] args[1] etc, add as many as needed.
The word "command" will be used to define the command name.

I'll add more info if needed
```

which should be self-explanatory.
