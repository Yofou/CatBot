Current Task(s):
(A)* Create Program to Generate Images based on the Spreadsheet
  > Run program such as "node app.js"
  > Program scans through Excel Spreadsheet
  > Gets each section for each monster as it's own image
(B) Realtime Solution to get Monster Information from Spreadsheet based on User Input
  > `+mhwhitzones anjanath` would filter the spreadsheet to show information for that monster
  > The end result would look similar to images I've sent to Chad, but obviously this is more dynamic
  > May consume more memory usage, and if possible, I'd like to not create images on the fly
    - Maybe host the spreadsheet on Google Drive, and retrieve data that way
  > This solution is *better* and more dynamic, but may cause *higher* memory usage
